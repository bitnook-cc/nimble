# Shadow Wolves

*Medium beast (shadow), neutral evil*

These otherworldly predators emerged after the Great Sundering, when tears in reality allowed creatures from the Shadowfell to slip into the material world. Shadow wolves appear as large wolves made of shifting darkness, their forms constantly rippling like smoke.

/>

## Tactics

Shadow wolves are intelligent pack hunters that use their supernatural abilities to devastating effect:

1. **Ambush Predators**: They hide in shadows until prey is close, then coordinate attacks
2. **Howl and Scatter**: The pack leader uses Shadow Howl to frighten enemies, then the pack spreads out to attack from multiple angles
3. **Hit and Run**: They use their superior speed and Shadow Stealth to attack, then fade back into darkness
4. **Protect the Alpha**: Younger wolves will sacrifice themselves to protect the pack leader

## Habitat & Behavior

- **Territory**: Shadow wolves claim areas with dense shadows—deep forests, ruins, cave systems
- **Pack Size**: 3-8 wolves led by an **Alpha Shadow Wolf** (use the same stats but increase hit points to 45 and give it one additional use of Shadow Howl)
- **Feeding**: They consume both flesh and shadow essence, leaving drained husks behind
- **Communication**: Silent hunters that coordinate through supernatural pack bonds

## Lore & Ecology

*"We found the merchant caravan at dawn, but there were no bodies—just empty clothes lying in perfect shadow-shapes on the ground."*
— Captain Thorne, Skyport Guard

### Origins
Shadow wolves first appeared shortly after the Great Sundering, leading scholars to believe they're either:
- Ordinary wolves mutated by shadow magic
- Creatures from the Shadowfell that crossed over during the catastrophe
- Manifestations of the world's collective trauma and fear

### In the World
- **The Umbral Woods**: A forest permanently shrouded in twilight where the largest shadow wolf pack roams
- **Urban Shadows**: Some packs have adapted to city life, hunting in alleyways and abandoned buildings
- **The Void Zones**: Shadow wolves are drawn to reality tears, possibly feeding on the chaotic energies

## Adventure Hooks

- **The Missing Caravan**: A trade route has been repeatedly attacked by shadow wolves. The merchants guild offers a substantial reward for clearing them out.
- **The Cursed Village**: A remote settlement is under nightly siege by shadow wolves. The creatures seem to be searching for something specific.
- **The Shadow Wolf Whisper**: A ranger claims they've learned to communicate with shadow wolves and wants to broker peace—but are they being controlled?
- **The Alpha's Lair**: Deep in the Umbral Woods lies a massive shadow wolf den. What treasures have they collected from their victims?
