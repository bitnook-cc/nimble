# The Shattered Realms

Long ago, the world was whole. The **Great Sundering** changed everything, fracturing reality itself and creating the patchwork of floating islands, pocket dimensions, and twisted landscapes that adventurers now call home.

## The Sundering

*"When the gods themselves went to war, creation itself was the battlefield."*
— Chronicles of the Last Oracle

A thousand years ago, a catastrophic magical event tore the world apart. Entire continents were lifted into the sky, oceans became floating spheres of water, and the very laws of nature became... flexible. The cause remains hotly debated:

- **The God War Theory**: Divine conflict shattered reality
- **The Arcane Cascade**: Mortal magic users pushed too far
- **The Cosmic Accident**: Planar energies collided catastrophically
- **The Dragon's Last Gambit**: Ancient dragons tried to reshape the world
