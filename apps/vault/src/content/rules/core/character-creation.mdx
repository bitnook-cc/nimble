# Character Creation

Creating a character in Nimble is designed to be quick and intuitive, getting you into the action as fast as possible. Follow these steps to bring your hero to life!

## Step 1: Choose Your Ancestry

Your **ancestry** determines your character's species and provides baseline traits, size category, and cultural background.

### Popular Ancestries

- **Human** - Versatile and ambitious
- **Elf** - Graceful and long-lived  
- **Dwarf** - Sturdy and traditionalist
- **Halfling** - Small but brave
- **Dragonborn** - Proud and draconic

Each ancestry grants:
- **Size category** (Small, Medium, Large)
- **Attribute bonuses** (+1 to two different attributes)
- **Ancestral traits** (special abilities or resistances)
- **Proficiencies** (skills or equipment)

## Step 2: Select Your Background

Your **background** represents what your character did before becoming an adventurer. This shapes their skills and starting equipment.

### Example Backgrounds

- **Folk Hero** - You're a local legend who stood up to tyranny
- **Scholar** - You spent years studying in academies or libraries  
- **Soldier** - You served in an army, militia, or guard
- **Criminal** - You lived outside the law (reformed or not!)
- **Artisan** - You practiced a trade or craft

Backgrounds provide:
- **Skill proficiencies** (usually 2-3 skills)
- **Starting equipment** (tools, weapons, or other gear)
- **Background feature** (special knowledge or connections)

## Step 3: Pick Your Class

Your **class** defines your character's role in combat and adventures. Each class has a unique playstyle and special abilities.

### The Core Classes

<ClassFeature
  name="Fighter"
  description="Masters of weapons and tactics who excel in direct combat"
  keyAttribute="Strength or Dexterity"
  hitDie="d10"
  features={["Action Surge", "Multiple Attacks", "Combat Maneuvers"]}
/>

<ClassFeature
  name="Wizard"
  description="Scholars of arcane magic who reshape reality with spells"
  keyAttribute="Intelligence"
  hitDie="d6"
  features={["Spellcasting", "Arcane Schools", "Ritual Magic"]}
/>

<ClassFeature
  name="Cleric"
  description="Divine champions who heal allies and smite enemies"
  keyAttribute="Will"
  hitDie="d8"
  features={["Divine Magic", "Channel Divinity", "Healing"]}
/>

<ClassFeature
  name="Rogue"
  description="Skilled infiltrators who strike from the shadows"
  keyAttribute="Dexterity"
  hitDie="d8"
  features={["Sneak Attack", "Expertise", "Cunning Actions"]}
/>

## Step 4: Assign Attributes

You have **27 points** to distribute among your four attributes. The cost per point depends on the final score:

| Final Score | Point Cost |
|-------------|------------|
| 8-13        | 1 point each |
| 14-15       | 2 points each |
| 16-17       | 3 points each |
| 18          | 4 points |

**Recommended spreads:**
- **Balanced**: 15, 14, 13, 12 (uses 25 points)
- **Specialized**: 17, 15, 12, 10 (uses 27 points)
- **Glass Cannon**: 18, 14, 10, 8 (uses 26 points)

## Step 5: Calculate Derived Stats

Once you have your attributes, calculate these important values:

<StatBlock
  character={{
    level: 1,
    hitPoints: "Class Hit Die + STR modifier",
    hitDice: "1 die of your class type",
    armorClass: "10 + DEX modifier + armor",
    initiative: "DEX modifier",
    speed: "30 feet (varies by ancestry)"
  }}
/>

## Step 6: Choose Skills

Your class grants proficiency with certain skills. You can typically choose 2-4 skills from your class list. Skills use the following attributes:

- **Athletics** (STR) - Climbing, swimming, jumping
- **Stealth** (DEX) - Moving unseen and unheard
- **Sleight of Hand** (DEX) - Pickpocketing, juggling
- **Investigation** (INT) - Finding clues and details
- **Arcana** (INT) - Knowledge of magic and spells
- **History** (INT) - Knowledge of past events
- **Insight** (WIL) - Reading people's intentions
- **Medicine** (WIL) - Treating wounds and illness
- **Perception** (WIL) - Noticing hidden things
- **Survival** (WIL) - Tracking and wilderness skills

## Step 7: Starting Equipment

Your class and background determine your starting equipment. Alternatively, you can buy equipment with starting gold (varies by class).

## Step 8: Final Details

Give your character:
- **Name** and **appearance**
- **Personality traits** and **quirks**
- **Ideals** and **motivations**
- **Bonds** to other characters or NPCs
- **Flaws** that make them interesting

## Quick Creation Example

Let's create **Lyra Swiftarrow**, an Elven Rogue:

1. **Ancestry**: Elf (+1 DEX, +1 INT, Keen Senses)
2. **Background**: Criminal (Stealth, Sleight of Hand proficiencies)
3. **Class**: Rogue (d8 hit die, DEX-based)
4. **Attributes**: STR 10, DEX 17, INT 14, WIL 12
5. **Skills**: Stealth, Sleight of Hand, Perception, Investigation
6. **Equipment**: Leather armor, shortsword, thieves' tools

Ready to adventure!
