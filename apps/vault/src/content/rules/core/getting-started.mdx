# Getting Started with Nimble

Welcome to **Nimble**, a tabletop role-playing game designed for fast-paced heroic fantasy adventures! Whether you're a veteran of the hobby or completely new to RPGs, this guide will get you started on your journey.

## What You Need

To play Nimble, you'll need:

## Core Concepts

Everything in Nimble revolves around the **d20 roll**:
