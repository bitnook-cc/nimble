# Advanced Combat Rules

These optional rules add depth and tactical complexity to Nimble RPG combat encounters.

## Initiative Variants

### Group Initiative
Instead of individual initiative, roll once for each side:
- **Player Characters**: Highest Dexterity + Initiative bonus
- **NPCs**: GM rolls for the group
- **Mixed Groups**: Each faction rolls separately

### Phased Initiative
Combat proceeds in phases:
1. **Declaration Phase**: All players declare intended actions
2. **Fast Actions Phase**: Dexterity 3+ characters act
3. **Standard Actions Phase**: All remaining characters act
4. **Slow Actions Phase**: Complex actions resolve

## Advanced Action Economy

### Reaction Actions
Characters can take reactions outside their turn:
- **Opportunity Attacks**: When enemies move past you
- **Counterspells**: Interrupt enemy spellcasting
- **Defensive Stances**: Reduce incoming damage

### Extended Actions
Some activities require multiple turns:
- **Rituals**: Complex magical workings
- **Crafting**: Creating items during downtime
- **Investigation**: Detailed examination of scenes

## Tactical Positioning

### Flanking
When attacking an enemy engaged by an ally:
- **Advantage**: Gain advantage on attack rolls
- **Positioning**: Requires tactical movement
- **Counter-flanking**: Smart enemies will attempt the same

### Cover and Concealment
Environmental factors affect combat:
- **Light Cover**: +1 to defense
- **Heavy Cover**: +3 to defense
- **Concealment**: Disadvantage to enemy attacks

## Master-Level Techniques

These techniques are available to characters with exceptional training or natural talent.
