# Advanced Combat Rules

<PatronContent>

## Advanced Initiative System

Beyond the basic initiative rules, experienced groups can use these enhanced mechanics:

### Group Initiative
Instead of individual rolls, each side rolls once:
- **Player Side**: Highest Dexterity player rolls for the group
- **Enemy Side**: GM rolls using the fastest enemy's Dexterity
- **Advantage**: Side with more members gets advantage on the roll

### Initiative Count System
For complex encounters with multiple factions:
1. Roll initiative for each faction (not individuals)
2. On each faction's turn, they act in any order they choose
3. Allows for more tactical coordination within groups

## Tactical Combat Options

**Head Shot** (Attack at disadvantage)
- +2 damage on hit

**Limb Shot** (Attack at disadvantage)  
- Normal damage
- Natural 20: Target drops held items or speed reduced by half

**Disarm Attempt**
- Attack vs. target's Athletics or Acrobatics
- Success: Target drops one held item
- No damage dealt

### Combat Maneuvers

**Shove** (Strength vs. Strength)
- Success: Push target 5 feet and knock prone
- Can be used in place of an attack

**Grapple** (Strength vs. Strength or Dexterity)

**Trip** (Athletics vs. Athletics or Acrobatics)

## Mass Combat Rules

For battles involving armies or large groups:

### Unit Scale
- Each "unit" represents 10-100 individuals
- Units have simplified stats (Attack, Defense, Morale, Size)
- Player characters can lead units or act as heroes

### Battle Resolution
1. **Deployment**: Position units on battlefield
2. **Initiative**: Roll for each army
3. **Unit Actions**: Move, attack, or perform special actions
4. **Hero Actions**: PCs can influence battle through personal actions

### Morale System
- Units have Morale scores (typically 8-16)
- Failed morale checks cause units to retreat or break
- Heroes can rally broken units with successful Social checks

## Extended Rest Rules

### Safe Rest Requirements
A safe rest requires 8 hours in a secure location with:
- Protection from the elements
- No immediate threats
- Access to food and water

- Success cancels the original spell

### Ritual Casting
Some spells can be cast as rituals:
